The title of my project for INST377: Al Alert
The link to Github pages for this project: https://xiyiy.github.io/INST377-Final-Project/

This site is compatible with most browsers, including those on mobile devices whether it be IOS or Android. All individuals who struggle with their everyday allergens are given the power to search for an allergen within a product's ingredients in a matter of seconds. 

On the left side of the home page, there are two entries that users can employ. To view general ingredients information, enter a barcode and press search. To search for an allergen enter the barcode of the product, press search, and enter an allergen, press search. The pie charts visualizing the composition of each ingredient in a product are achieved through Charts.js. 

On the right side will be the allergen assistant, Al. Al will alert the
user with a bright red message to inform of allergen detection. 
The style of the page is courtesy of custom CSS and Flexbox. 

The API utilized in this project is from Open Food Facts and an example of how the API is incorporated into the project includes being able to fetch product information from a valid barcode entered by the user (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/737628064502.json).
